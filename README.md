Utility scripts
============

Scripts for converting and moving genetic data files or for preparing files for data analysis. There are also a few scripts for summarizing results of analyses. These scripts are in different states of general usability. Some will be usable to any file or project, such as file_converter.py and concatenator.py. Others may be still specifically written for projects I was working on. I can make any script more general if needed. If it looks like something you are interested in using and you cannot get it to work, send an email to cwlinkem@gmail.com, and I will try to help.
